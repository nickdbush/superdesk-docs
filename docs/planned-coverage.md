The Superdesk Planning Component (SPC) is an optional addition to the Superdesk interface that better enables editors and journalists to work together to cover stories as they unfold.
SPC allows editors to assign news coverage of unfolding Events to desks or specific users using through the existing Superdesk workflow.
The component can also ingest external calendars and generate events automatically.

SPC also integrates tightly with Newshub, Sourcefabric's content client portal for news agencies.
Customers are able to see and subscribe to upcoming events and planned coverage, and see the full content when it becomes available.

There are three important concepts in the planning component: events, planning items, and coverage.

- Events hold data about things that are happening in the world. You can think of them like events in your personal calendar â€“ they have a start and end, can be recurring, and have locations. They cannot be assigned to users. Instead, they are used to organise and manage coverage.
- Planning items are created from events and contain information about the specific coverage and reporting that you have planned.
- Coverage items are the individual units of reporting that have been planned. Coverage items can be assigned to desks for editors to assign to specific writers, or even assigned directly from the planning component. Coverage does not have to be just text and images; links to videos, infographics, livestreams and live blogs can all be added as coverage.
