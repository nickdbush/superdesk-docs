Superdesk is designed around the concept of **desks**.
They mirror desks that you might find in a physical newsroom, such as the news desk, sports desk, or features desk.
They group users and content together in separated spaces.

Desks have **stages**.
These represent the different parts of the workflow that content goes through before it is published, such as the authoring stage, approval stage, and so on.
Content is moved between stages as it moves through the editorial workflow.
Content can also be moved between desks, but this is typically rarer.
