Templates are content profiles with custom content and metadata pre-defined.
For instance, a university using Superdesk may have templates for each campus, with pre-defined tags for each location.

The configuration options for templates can be found under Menu > Settings > Templates.

There are two types of templates available:

- Create templates are used by authors to create content with a specific content profile.
- Highlight templates configure how specific elements (such as headlines or abstracts) from multiple articles are displayed in one highlights document.

Once templates have been created, they can be assigned to desks.
This allows authors to then create content using a specific content profile.

Templates can also be used to automatically generate documents at a specific stage in a desk at a defined schedule (this can be found under the Automatically Create Item panel in the sidebar).
For example, the Entertainment Desk might schedule a box office report to drop into the working stage at 6am every Monday for a reporter to pick up.

## Template fields

Documents in Superdesk can be much more than just text.
They are constructed from a variety of fields, which allows for a nearly infinite variety of structures.
Some of the fields that can be mixed and matched include:

- Rich text areas support embeds, images, annotations, comments, and traditional formatting options such as bold, italics, and underline.
- Single line text fields are great for headlines; these can have a configured maximum length and limit the input to just characters.
- Image fields enable setting featured media on posts or configuring an image gallery.

Alongside content fields, templates also have configurable metadata fields, such as the attributed authors, slugline, and editorial notes.

The pre-defined fields that build up content profiles are themselves figured somewhere.

The configuration options for templates can be found under Menu > Settings > Content Profiles.

Users cannot directly create items from a specific content profile.
Instead, documents are created from templates.
Once a document has been created, its profile can be changed using the dropdown in the header of the editor.
